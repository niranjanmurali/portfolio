    <h2><i>“I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I am always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of the team stay on track. In my last role, I created a new filing process that increased departmental efficiency by 25 percent.”</i></h2>

    <h2><i>“I am a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients. In my previous job, my clients’ customer satisfaction scores were 15 percent over the company average.”</i></h2>

    <h2><i>I am a natural leader. I have eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people. I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I am not in a leadership role because if I do not know the answer, I will at least point them in the right direction. In my last two roles, I was promoted to leadership positions after less than a year with the company.”</i></h2>

    <h2><i>“I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.”</i></h2>
